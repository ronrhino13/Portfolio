<p>One of my personal interests is superheroes. Not just costumes or powers or their books and movies but the characters motivation. The most relatable and iconic hero that I favor the most is Spider-Man.</p>



<p>When I was a kid, I first saw a picture of him on a VHS Tape. Overtime, I learned more about him, what his motivations were as a hero, and how I relate to the personal struggles he goes through every day. One thing that came to mind was how did this character become such an icon for Marvel? In the 1960&#8217;s, Marvel comics had began their superhero age with the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, X-Men, and many more. It was co-creator Stan Lee that came up with the idea for Spider-Man after he saw a fly on the wall and though of different insect heroes.</p>



<p>When it came to Spider-Man, Stan decided to make his hero stand out from the rest as a teenager but publisher Martin Goodman felt that it wouldn&#8217;t be a good decision. Stan fought hard for his hero character and Goodman decided to publish the story in Amazing Fantasy comics issue 15. When it was released, the story of Spider-Man became one of the most popular and best selling comics at the time. Eventually, Marvel released Spider-Man&#8217;s first official comic in 1963.</p>



<p>Over the next 50 years, Spider-Man continues to inspire comic book readers and movie goers to learn that we have responsibilities within our lives and we have the power to take care of them.</p>
